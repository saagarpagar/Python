# Python
# Core Python Overview ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a small Python script I made to practice and understand **core Python concepts**.  
Itâ€™s a single file that goes through variables, data types, conditions, loops, functions, lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries, and importing modules â€” with **simple but meaningful examples**.  

I created this as part of my learning journey so I can always come back, revise quickly, and also share it with others who are starting from scratch.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find inside the script:
1. **Variables & Data Types** â€“ Integers, strings, floats, booleans.
2. **If-Else Conditions** â€“ Simple and multiple condition checks.
3. **Loops** â€“ `for` and `while` loops with examples.
4. **Functions** â€“ With and without parameters, return values.
5. **Lists** â€“ Create, access, modify, and iterate.
6. **Sets** â€“ Unique values and basic operations.
7. **Tuples** â€“ Immutable data storage and unpacking.
8. **Dictionaries** â€“ Key-value storage and updating.
9. **Importing Modules** â€“ Using built-in modules like `math` and `datetime`.
